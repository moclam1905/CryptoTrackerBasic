-Gaining expertise in the MVI (Model-View-Intent) pattern has provided a transparent and reliable method for managing the app's state.

-UI State Management: Efficiently managing UI states in Jetpack Compose for a smooth user experience.

-Leveraging Ktor for network operations and executing API requests with robust error handling techniques.

-Utilizing Koin for dependency injection has made the application more modular and simplified the testing process.

-Delving into adaptive navigation has greatly enhanced the app’s flexibility and overall user experience.

-Creating the line chart involved an extensive exploration of mathematical concepts and calculations. I found great satisfaction in overcoming the challenges of applying Canvas within Jetpack Compose.
